### Day 45: Wednesday 5th 2022

**Today's Progress**:Decided today to stop working on the pacman project from Scrimba as 1) I understand most of the new methods that will be covered 2) Don't feel that motivated to complete another JS game so decided to skip this module and start learning APIs.  This was some good practice getting used to the fetch and then methods then using the data retrieved from the API to update on the web page

**Todays Goals:** 
- ~~Start API Module on Scrimba~~
- Flex zombie chapter
