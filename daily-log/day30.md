### Day 30: Tuesday 21st 2021

**Today's Progress**:   Fresh start to how I will log my daily logs, will put here what I did by end of current day or first thing next morning.  

**Thoughts:** I had neglected the actual logging of 100 days of code but still maintaining at least an hour a day mainly towards the scrimba javascript challenges from tomorrow I will change the layout of my daily logs as don't feel I benefit from the thoughts section
