### Day 8: Monday 29th 2021

**Today's Progress**:   

**Thoughts:** First week done, overall feel quite proud what I have kept going this week, little dip at the weekend compared to the Mon-Fri effort but overall pleased and will continue back to Scrimba snake game today.  I do need to prioritise studying today and tomorrow so will be limiting myself to the one hour for coding.
