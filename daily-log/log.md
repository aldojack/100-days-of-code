# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday 22nd, 2021 (Introduction Day)

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to commit to 100 days of code, I had a jQuery assessment today which took up most of coding time for the day.  

Despite jQuery not being as popular as once was I have found it useful to learn.  I felt something click when trying to get properties of an object and also got a boost of not giving up despite a short time window to solve and submit my work.  

**Thoughts:** I felt OK today despite having 2 assessments today, I felt confident on my knowledge of jquery and that I could overcome any task, afterwards I was quite proud as feel I did well and hopefully earn an A for the Unit.  

**Link to work:** No work to submit.
