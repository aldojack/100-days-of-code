### Day 3: Wednesday 24th 2021

**Today's Progress**:   

**Thoughts:** Feeling motivated to finish of the Dice Game before the afternoon before my e-reader arrives as will need to set that up and revise and take notes on it for Database Application test in 2 weeks.  Possibley look into finishing some javascript from Frontend Masters or Codecademy later this afternoon/evening.
