### Day 9: Tuesday 30th 2021

**Today's Progress**:   

**Thoughts:** Had to prep for a 50 question Database test was a little stressed but quietly confident, took most of my morning and afternoon then working so managed a little of the snake game but felt a little bit of a slog just haven't been that into it but will push through tomorrow
