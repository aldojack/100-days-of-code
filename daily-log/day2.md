### Day 2: Tuesday 23nd, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:   Today I started Scrimbas Dice game after work, made some tweaks on my own to branch into classes whilst still trying to keep the code DRY, stil got some work to do tomorrow.  

**Thoughts:** OK day considering morning was spent writing and reading about Database Applications for upcoming test
